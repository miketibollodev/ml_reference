    "**Cross-Validation**: a technique used to evaluate the generalization performance of a model. This is done by iteratively splitting the original training dataset into smaller subsets of training and testing data, which is then fit on a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose is not to train a model, but to evaluate the generalization performance of a model while avoiding overfitting and underfitting. Specifically, overfitting occurs by training on the entire dataset without some subset of validation; cross-validation avoids this by creating variations of training-validation sets. Underfitting is avoided - which inherently occurs when smaller datasets are used - by using multiple iterations of different datasets.\n",
